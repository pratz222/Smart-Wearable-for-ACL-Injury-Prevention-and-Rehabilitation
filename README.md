# Smart-Wearable-for-ACL-Injury-Prevention-and-Rehabilitation
🔍 Project Overview: 

We developed a cutting-edge wearable medical device that monitors knee angles in real-time using IoT technology. Our goal? To prevent ACL injuries and aid in rehabilitation. 🦵💡

🛠️ How It Works:

We utilized two MPU6050 accelerometer/gyroscope sensors—one attached to the femur bone and the other to the tibia bone.
By combining Euler angles and vector theory, we accurately calculated the relative knee angle based on sensor data.

An EMG sensor continuously monitored ACL ligament extension and contraction, providing crucial insights.
Real-time data was seamlessly transmitted to Google Firebase RTDB via the cloud.
Our sleek Android app displayed crisp visualizations of knee angles and issued alerts when thresholds were exceeded. 📱📈

🔔 Instant Alerts & Vibration Feedback:

To enhance user experience, we added a vibration motor to the thigh sensor setup. When knee angles exceeded user-defined thresholds, the wearable vibrated—acting as a gentle reminder. 📳
The app also featured a voice feature, providing real-time knee angle updates during exercise. 🗣️

📊 Track Your Progress:

Our app not only displayed real-time data but also stored historical angle values. Doctors and patients alike can download personalized reports, tracking improvements over time. 📈📉
